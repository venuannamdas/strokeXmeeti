It is important to have awareness of Stroke, which can occur due to multiple reasons including late pregnancies, with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, heart disease. Occurs when the supply of blood to the brain is reduced or blocked completely, which prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Urgent medical attention is usually recommended by healthcare providers. It is dangerous and life-threatening. This condition is treatable by a medical professional. However, it can last several years or be lifelong.</p>
